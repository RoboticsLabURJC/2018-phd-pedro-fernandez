### November

**Week from 2 to 7**


I am going to read TFM's Ignacio Arranz in ðŸ“‚   **/Users/user/PhD**
This TFM is my foundation in this part of research. I'll take all code and ideas to begin with.

Next week Proposal: Install and execute all parts, frameworks, libraries and "play" with them.


**Week up to 30 November**

Goal: play with OpenAI Gym Pendulum.

The explanations of environments are here:

https://github.com/ZhengXinyue/Model-Predictive-Control/blob/master/Naive_MPC/Pure_MPC_Pendulum.py

https://towardsdatascience.com/reinforcement-learning-with-openai-d445c2c687d2
https://leonardoaraujosantos.gitbook.io/artificial-inteligence/artificial_intelligence/markov_decision_process


I finally implemented Pendulum and cartPole, even with NN in Pendulum.

### December

**Week from 1 to 16 december**

- DQN. I am going to work wiht DQN. First steps only learn and undestand its implementation. I will follow DeepMind paper: [Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning)

- Installing Gazebo and ROS in MacOS 10.15.7 (Catalina):
1. http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install&tut=install_on_mac

- Install Ubuntu20.04, Python 3.7, Gazebo 11, BehaviorStudio, Ros Noetic (last Version). See details in Install.md

Get started, officially!!


Thesis: TrafficMonitor.

After analyzing for long days, and discover new tendencies in AI applied to computer vision, and others fields, search and navigate through others universities, mainly in USA and think in what kind of apps will be success taking them to the markets, I decided focus on Traffic monitor with computer vision and AI techniques. This will be our start point.

At first, we are going to research in traffic monitor. Several weeks ago, I was reading Redouane Kachach doctoral thesis “Monitorización visual automática de tráfico rodado” from Alicante University and directed by Dr. JoseMaria Cañas.

Now, we have a concrete goal, next two weeks, I am going to:



Read again doctoral thesis
Analyze state of the art in traffic monitor: 

Companies sell those services
Most relevant algorithms
Real solutions in main countries

That points are the beginning to find out the real moment of true and will be the baseline for our thesis


Install TrafficMonitor app developed in Redouane thesis and know how it works.







October 18th 2018

We begin searching traffic monitoring apps and companies which are developed some kind of algorithms related to.

Trafficvision.com, company dedicated wich i am loooking for (it seems very interested). It offers:

Improves incident detection and response times
Turns your existing cameras into highway sensors that notify you of incidents while collecting data 24/7 
Improves efficiency of manual processes by operations staff
Deploys latest features and improvements immediately, with no need to deal directly with cameras
Provides traffic industry-specific analytics, as compared to security-industry algorithms not designed for changing light conditions and constant panning, tilting, and zooming

And they work in special cases such as:

Monitoring for incidents or collecting data during special events
Construction zones
Problem areas requiring quantified data points such as wrong way drivers, stopped vehicles, volume increases/decreases, or frequent slow downs


TrafficVision analytics can automatically classify vehicles for detailed volume assessment


In its website, I discovered a new term: Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS). In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Traffic_Management_System we can find any important features or functional areas:

Real-time traffic monitoring
Dynamic message sign monitoring and control
Incident monitoring
Traffic camera monitoring and control
Active Traffic Management (ATM)
Chain control
Ramp meter monitoring and control
Arterial management
Traffic signal monitoring and control
Automated warning systems
Road Weather Information System (RWIS) monitoring
Highway advisory radio
Urban Traffic Management and Control



Advantech.com: Taiwan company with solutions for intelligent traffic control

Youtube Videokinetics: ugly video, music disturbing, but a good overall solution with many functions for traffic monitoring


Youtube SpeedCam very easy app for monitoring speed vehicules. www.raserabwehr.de
Datafromsky shows aerial images controlling, monitoring, analysing traffic from a drone: GOOD!!!
http://datafromsky.com/applications/traffic-research/, for instance, that is all I was searching for Peruvian project. In their research area they have next:

Motion pattern classification, Abnormal motion pattern detection,
Traffic mining, Prediction of non-recurrent short-term traffic patterns,
Developing next generation driving behavior models, Trajectory clustering,
New perspective on merging behavior – gap seeking instead of acceptance behavior,
Evaluation of traffic simulation methods / models on real data, Capacity estimations,
Traffic congestion studies, Travel-time, Vehicle counting, Trajectory based analysis,
Road safety, Pedestrian and cyclist safety, Road-user interactions, Smart analysis,
Driver decision making and complex multi-actor interactions, Traffic instabilities,
Empirical evidence of multi-anticipation (drivers have multiple leaders),
Study of behavior adaptation effect.




October 19th

Keep researching. In IEEE.org I find different new terms for my work:

feature extraction,
image classification,
learning (artificial intelligence),
multilayer perceptrons,
neural nets,
pattern classification,
road traffic,
traffic engineering computing,
video signal processing,
video surveillance
INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing
road traffic conditions classification,
image content,
convolutional neural network,
traffic control strategies,
traffic streams,
video traffic monitoring,
traffic data,
video surveillance data,
video content,
video data,
traffic observation sites,
traffic management,
DLN,
deep learning network,
traffic control measures




Good paper about ATMS and its features...it’s from 1993 but contains relevant ideas for me.
https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/1993/WS-93-04/WS93-04-008.pdf

Another good paper for visioning ATMS: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59c3ed7b197aeabbd2a51a3b/t/5b2a504b88251ba2adbe4c35/1529499723388/TS06_Paper15539.pdf



I am going to read again Radou thesis. It will be my first entry in this world.

 

26th October.

Last week, it began doctorate program officially. In virtual classroom discovered contents, links, videos related to advance in the program. 


I come into Radou thesis again. I read 6 or 7 weeks ago, and this is the start point of my research work.


Intelligent Transport System (ITS), when I make a googel search, I find in the first place: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_system
ITS is a broad concept which includes many features related to traffic and transportation. Well, it’s a good high level start point. The wikipedia page is outdated in some concepts.

29th October

I keep up reading Radou thesis 	
			
Automatic incidents detection (AID) is a broad concept for companies which are working on.

Companies referenced in thesis:
FLIR
Siemens
Indra
Kapsch
Q-Free
Thales
Safram Morpho Mesta fusion radar (very interesting, may 2018)

Those companies are big in terms of incomes and business, and they have differents areas of research. Most of them develop in tech such as defense, consulting, telecom, and others fields. Being very large companies, they have been able to invest in the whole concept of  Intelligent Transportation Systems which involves not only vision or payments, but systems infrastructure and architecture, sensors, radars, and everything about managing  as well.



No code yet!!!!!



				

30th October

After my biweekly meeting with JoseMaria, next period I am going to:
run Smart Traffic Sensor which is developed in C++
Tagging images

Let’s go!!!

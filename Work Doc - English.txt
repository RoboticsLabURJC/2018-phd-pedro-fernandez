Get started, officially!!


Gracias a mi tutor, Dr. JoseMaria Cañas por acogerme en su equipo. Cuando empecé a pensar en esta loca idea de continuar estudios de doctorado mis primeras ideas eran de que podía empezar un camino complejo y sin final, con un horizonte de sacrificios personales y familiares que me cuestionaba continuamente. En la primera reunión con JoseMaria me dí cuenta que el camino iba a ser difícil, largo y complicado, pero que iba a contar con apoyo continuado de él y su equipo. Esto ha hecho que me viera comprometido en este viaje al conocimiento.


Gracias








Thesis: TrafficMonitor.


After analyzing for long days, and discover new tendencies in AI applied to computer vision, and others fields, search and navigate through others universities, mainly in USA and think in what kind of apps will be success taking them to the markets, I decided focus on Traffic monitor with computer vision and AI techniques. This will be our start point.


At first, we are going to research in traffic monitor. Several weeks ago, I was reading Redouane Kachach doctoral thesis “Monitorización visual automática de tráfico rodado” from Alicante University and directed by Dr. JoseMaria Cañas.


Now, we have a concrete goal, next two weeks, I am going to:






1. Read again doctoral thesis
2. Analyze state of the art in traffic monitor: 


   1. Companies sell those services
   2. Most relevant algorithms
   3. Real solutions in main countries


That points are the beginning to find out the real moment of true and will be the baseline for our thesis




1. Install TrafficMonitor app developed in Redouane thesis and know how it works.

We begin searching traffic monitoring apps and companies which are developed some kind of algorithms related to.


Trafficvision.com, company dedicated wich i am loooking for (it seems very interested). It offers:


* Improves incident detection and response times
* Turns your existing cameras into highway sensors that notify you of incidents while collecting data 24/7 
* Improves efficiency of manual processes by operations staff
* Deploys latest features and improvements immediately, with no need to deal directly with cameras
* Provides traffic industry-specific analytics, as compared to security-industry algorithms not designed for changing light conditions and constant panning, tilting, and zooming


And they work in special cases such as:


* Monitoring for incidents or collecting data during special events
* Construction zones
* Problem areas requiring quantified data points such as wrong way drivers, stopped vehicles, volume increases/decreases, or frequent slow downs




TrafficVision analytics can automatically classify vehicles for detailed volume assessment




In its website, I discovered a new term: Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS). In https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Traffic_Management_System we can find any important features or functional areas:


* Real-time traffic monitoring
* Dynamic message sign monitoring and control
* Incident monitoring
* Traffic camera monitoring and control
* Active Traffic Management (ATM)
* Chain control
* Ramp meter monitoring and control
* Arterial management
* Traffic signal monitoring and control
* Automated warning systems
* Road Weather Information System (RWIS) monitoring
* Highway advisory radio
* Urban Traffic Management and Control






Advantech.com: Taiwan company with solutions for intelligent traffic control


Youtube Videokinetics: ugly video, music disturbing, but a good overall solution with many functions for traffic monitoring




Youtube SpeedCam very easy app for monitoring speed vehicules. www.raserabwehr.de
Datafromsky shows aerial images controlling, monitoring, analysing traffic from a drone: GOOD!!!
http://datafromsky.com/applications/traffic-research/, for instance, that is all I was searching for Peruvian project. In their research area they have next:


* Motion pattern classification, Abnormal motion pattern detection,
* Traffic mining, Prediction of non-recurrent short-term traffic patterns,
* Developing next generation driving behavior models, Trajectory clustering,
* New perspective on merging behavior – gap seeking instead of acceptance behavior,
* Evaluation of traffic simulation methods / models on real data, Capacity estimations,
* Traffic congestion studies, Travel-time, Vehicle counting, Trajectory based analysis,
* Road safety, Pedestrian and cyclist safety, Road-user interactions, Smart analysis,
* Driver decision making and complex multi-actor interactions, Traffic instabilities,
* Empirical evidence of multi-anticipation (drivers have multiple leaders),
* Study of behavior adaptation effect.








October 19th


Keep researching. In IEEE.org I find different new terms for my work:


   * feature extraction,
   * image classification,
   * learning (artificial intelligence),
   * multilayer perceptrons,
   * neural nets,
   * pattern classification,
   * road traffic,
   * traffic engineering computing,
   * video signal processing,
   * video surveillance
* INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing
   * road traffic conditions classification,
   * image content,
   * convolutional neural network,
   * traffic control strategies,
   * traffic streams,
   * video traffic monitoring,
   * traffic data,
   * video surveillance data,
   * video content,
   * video data,
   * traffic observation sites,
   * traffic management,
   * DLN,
   * deep learning network,
   * traffic control measures








Good paper about ATMS and its features...it’s from 1993 but contains relevant ideas for me.
https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Workshops/1993/WS-93-04/WS93-04-008.pdf


Another good paper for visioning ATMS: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59c3ed7b197aeabbd2a51a3b/t/5b2a504b88251ba2adbe4c35/1529499723388/TS06_Paper15539.pdf






I am going to read again Radou thesis. It will be my first entry in this world.


 


26th October.


Last week, it began doctorate program officially. In virtual classroom discovered contents, links, videos related to advance in the program. 




I come into Radou thesis again. I read 6 or 7 weeks ago, and this is the start point of my research work.




Intelligent Transport System (ITS), when I make a googel search, I find in the first place: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_transportation_system
ITS is a broad concept which includes many features related to traffic and transportation. Well, it’s a good high level star point. The wikipedia page is outdated in some concepts.


29th October


I keep up reading Radou thesis         
                        
Automatic incidents detection (AID) is a broad concept for companies which are working on.


Companies referenced in thesis that I could navigate in their web pages:
FLIR
Siemens
Indra
Kapsch
Q-Free
Thales
Safram Morpho Mesta fusion radar (very interesting, may 2018)
